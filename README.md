# mathGame
This program is a math game whose output numbers will be random based off of what you put and whose operations can be decided by the user. The program will also notify you if you have gotten the answer correct or incorrect and will keep track of how you are doing by adding a point (when the answer is correct) or by decreasing a point (when the answer is incorrect).
